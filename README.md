Cstudy: Preparing for C Language Coding Tests
Welcome to the Cstudy repository! This project is part of a structured study group aimed at mastering C language and preparing for coding tests. Our goal is to collaboratively enhance our problem-solving skills and deepen our understanding of C language through continuous practice and feedback.

📚 Project Overview
This project is designed to help participants:

Improve proficiency in C language with a focus on coding test preparation.
Tackle a variety of algorithm problems typically found in coding tests.
Share and manage study materials and problem solutions via GitHub.
We aim to foster both self-directed learning and collaborative problem solving. By working together, sharing insights, and providing feedback, we can enhance each other's understanding and excel in coding tests.

🚀 Key Objectives
C Language Mastery: Learn and apply key concepts in C, including functions, data types, control structures, and pointers.
Algorithmic Problem Solving: Strengthen algorithmic thinking by solving a range of coding problems.
GitHub Collaboration: Use GitHub to track progress, share resources, and provide peer feedback.
Mock Coding Tests: Engage in timed mock tests to simulate real coding test environments and assess our readiness.
